# üëã Hi
Hi, I‚Äôm @allenstetson
I'm a self-taught professional programmer with over 20 years of experience in the film industry.

# üíº Career
After two years as a project Manager in Hewlett Packard's Media Solutions group, I began my first "industry" job at PDI/DreamWorks. This began a 15 year career with the company, including a move to Los Angeles where I worked at the DreamWorks Animation headquarters. I spent time as a Technical Director for Animation, Surfacing, Lighting, Crowds, FX, Layout, Commercial, and Stereo Conversion, as a Lead Technical Director, and as a Supervising Technical Director. I spent several years on the artistic side as a Department Supervisor for Crowds, a highly technical department.

Following my tenure at DWA, I was employed by Weta Digital for several years as the Lead for the motion capture support team in Los Angeles where we worked for James Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment on premises, ensuring that the mocap team had all of the software that they needed to be successful in production on Avatar 2 and subsequent sequels. This job presented a wide variety of unique challenges, including all of my supervision being across the globe in New Zealand, along with the pipeline team that provided the core software for our scene description, etc. We had to be tremendously self-reliant for training, features, fixes, and management.

Ultimately I ended up in my current role at Blizzard Animation in Cinematics (part of Story & Franchise Development) where I am both an Associate Lead Pipeline Engineer as well as a Layout Technical Director. I lead a small team in Pipeline who are tasked with maintaining and extending our asset database as well as our Media and Review pipeline and a host of pipeline technologies for the studio.

# üëÄ Interests
It's been said that my hobby is having hobbies. I enjoy Home Automation, Voice Interaction (Amazon Alexa), Home Networking, Lego, Gardening, Hiking/Camping/Backpacking, Video Games (Overwatch, Minecraft Dungeons, Star Wars Squadrons & Battlefront II, RetroPie...), Dungeons & Dragons, Music (bass, saxaphone, vocals), Videography and Filmmaking, and firearms (target shooting). I volunteer as a Cub Scout Den Leader (3+ years). I volunteer for my local and former church both as a web developer (www.st-clare.org), videographer, and musician (playing bass and singing on Sundays). In the past I have been trained in CERT (Community Emergency Response Team), was certified in First Aid and AED, and led a disaster preparedness program for my neighborhood.  I studied Martial Arts for 8 years, achieving high ranks in Kenpo karate and a working knowledge of Seidokan Aikido.

I am an ambassador for Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion with my company, and am passionate about gaining an awareness of our unconscious biases so that we might overcome them, in speaking up and speaking out against inappropriate words or behaviors in an effort to change our culture and stereotypical industry "norms", and in being a trusted ally for the marginalized and those who are discriminated against.

# üå± Currently Learning
I just completed a Machine Learning course with NVidia, and have a keen interest in ML and DL.  I'm learning about USD as our studio adopts it.  I continue to learn on a daily basis as I continue working in Python, AWS, APIs and databases. I have a hobby that necessitates me learning OpenCV with Raspberry Pi.

# üíûÔ∏è Collaboration
Given my non-existant free time both at work and at home, with any spare time fully devoted to my family, collaboration is off the table for me, unless our interests align.
