# üëã Hi
Hi, I‚Äôm @allenstetson
I'm a senior software engineer and senior manager 25+ years of experience in the film and video game industries.

# üíº Career
After two years as a project Manager in Hewlett Packard's Media Solutions group, I began my first "industry" job at PDI/DreamWorks. This began a 15 year career with the company, including a move to Los Angeles where I worked at the DreamWorks Animation headquarters. I spent a majority of my time as a Technical Director for Animation, Surfacing, Lighting, Crowds, FX, Layout, Consumer Products, and Stereo Conversion, growing into a Lead Technical Director, and Supervising Technical Director. I also spent several years on the artistic side as a Department Supervisor for Crowds, a highly technical department.

Following my tenure at DWA, I was employed by Weta Digital for several years as the Lead for the motion capture and previsualization support team in Los Angeles where we worked for James Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment on premises, ensuring that the mocap and previz teams had all of the software that they needed to be successful in production on Avatar 2 and subsequent sequels. This job presented a wide variety of unique challenges, including my supervision being across the globe in New Zealand along with the pipeline team that provided the core software for our scene description, etc. We had to be tremendously self-reliant for training, features, fixes, and management, budgeting, and talent acquisition.

Ultimately I ended up in my current role at Blizzard Animation in Cinematics (part of Story & Franchise Development) where I have served as a Software Engineer (Pipeline), a Senior Technical Director (Layout), and now Senior Manager of the Pipeline dedpartment. We are tasked with maintaining and extending a wide variety of pipeline technologies for the studio, from software environments and continuous integration, to asset databases and APIs, to artist-facing tools for media & review, disk management, production management, tool frameworks, and beyond.

# üëÄ Interests
It's been said that my hobby is having hobbies. I enjoy Home Automation, Voice Interaction (Amazon Alexa), Home Networking, Lego, Gardening, Hiking/Camping/Backpacking, Video Games (recently Overwatch, Minecraft Dungeons, various RetroPie titles...), Boardgames, Dungeons & Dragons, Music (bass, saxaphone, vocals), Videography and Filmmaking, and firearms (target shooting). I volunteered for 5 years as a Cub Scout Den Leader. I volunteer for my local and former church both as a web developer (www.st-clare.org), videographer, and musician (playing bass and singing on Sundays). In the past I have been trained in CERT (Community Emergency Response Team), was certified in First Aid and AED, and led a disaster preparedness program for my neighborhood. I studied Martial Arts for 8 years, achieving high ranks in Kenpo karate and a working knowledge of Seidokan Aikido.

I am an ambassador for Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion with my company (a program called Way2Play, as well as a culture group which I started), and am passionate about gaining an awareness of our unconscious biases so that we might overcome them, in speaking up and speaking out in an effort to change our culture and stereotypical industry "norms", and in being a trusted ally for the marginalized and disadvantaged.

I am an active member of the Visual Effects Society, a global honorary society recognizing excellence in VFX. I am a co-recipient of two Academy Awards (Shrek, Avatar - The Way of Water), and I spent over a decade as a member of The Animation Guild, Local 839.

# üå± Currently Learning
I completed a Machine Learning course with NVidia, and have a keen interest in ML and DL. I'm developing a survival-style game in Unreal 5 in an effort to learn that tool more intimately. I'm learning about USD as our studio adopts it. I continue to learn on a daily basis as I continue working in Python, AWS, APIs and databases.

# üíûÔ∏è Collaboration
Given my non-existant free time both at work and at home, with any spare time fully devoted to my family, collaboration is only possible if our interests and current undertakings align.
